Many people struggle with staying fit over time, but the benefits of fitness definitely outweigh the costs. With some commitment and motivation, you can maintain your physical fitness for years to come!</p><p>Come up with a daily walking, jogging or cycling routine that fits with your schedule (i.e. go for a jog everyday at 6:00 p.m.). After a while you can increase your distance, speed, and the length of your workout.</p><p>Go out of your way to walk more.
